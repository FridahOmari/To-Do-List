## Project Setup Instructions and Live Links.
This Project was created in **development mode** and later on built and published to **production mode**. More information on working around the 2 different modes can be found on the [CREATE-REACT-APP.md](./CREATE-REACT-APP.md). In order for the project to work universally, 2 separate repositories were made, one for the back end (to host our locally created Back end for universal accessibility) and the other for the front end. The back-end is hosted on Heroku, and you can view the raw JSON file at  https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/jipange-app
